# learning-vue
I followed the guide doc of vue, in this repo are some practices about that.

Component part is in the path '/component-part/src/components/', such as props, event and v-model.
Basic directive is in the path '/basic-directive/'
You can refer to my code to learning vue doc! It would be much clear for you to understand.
